                <h2>Temple Of The Tooth</h2>
                <p>The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic or Sri Dalada Maligawa, commonly known as the Glorious
                    Tooth Temple, is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace
                    complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha.
                    It was built in the 17th century and proudly boasts it is the home of Buddha's tooth. The
                    tooth is kept in a two-story inner shrine fronted by two large elephant tusks.Since ancient
                    times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that
                    whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. The relic was historically held
                    by Sinhalese kings. The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple
                    and the relic.

                <h2>Sri Maha Bodiya</h2>
                <p>The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is a sacred Bo tree, or Ficus religiosa, that stands in the Mahamewna Gardens
                    in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Not only is it the closest authentic living link to Gautama Buddha, it
                    is also the oldest human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date and a recorded history.
                    About 2,600 years ago, Lord Gautama Buddha sat with his back against an Esathu tree on the banks of
                    the Neranjana River in Bodhgaya, India. It was at this moment, as he sat against the tree, that the
                    Buddha is said to have achieved enlightenment. In doing so, the tree also gained a venerated status.
                    It became known as the Bodhi tree, and pilgrims came to see it even within the lifetime of the Buddha.

                <h2>White Water Rafting Adventure In Kithulgala </h2>
                <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to
                    navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of
                    rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience. This activity as an adventure
                    sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10
                    feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts
                    propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.
                    Rivet in this amazing experience of white water rafting in Kelani River at Kitulgala, which offers
                    both the beginner and expert a thrilling rafting experience.
